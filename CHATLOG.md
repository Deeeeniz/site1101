# CHATLOG — Raw session extract

This file contains the unabridged raw logs and important outputs captured during the interactive session where the repository `ADA_Proj` was edited. It is a best-effort reconstruction from the assistant's recorded tool outputs and edits (commands, file reads, build outputs, and git operations).

---

## Session summary
- Repository: `ADA_Proj` (owner: Deeeeniz)
- Branch: `main`
- Local workspace path: `C:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj`
- Main source: `ADA_Proj1j.md` (Jekyll markdown)
- CSS: `ADA_CSS.css`
- JS: `ADA_ProjJS.js`
- Generated site: `_site/index.html`

---

## Chronological raw activity (commands, outputs, edits)

Note: Some outputs were captured from PowerShell and helper tools; timestamps were not preserved.

1) Initial build / status checks (examples captured):

- `git status` → showed `ADA_Proj1j.md` modified and `assets/My Avatar.jpg` untracked (early state)

- Commits pushed earlier in session (examples):
  - `46e33aa` — Add avatar photo and update markdown
  - `e02ecfa` — Fix nav buttons stretch: add align-self start
  - `74b7cfb` — earlier commit referencing `avatar.svg` placeholder

2) Investigation: discrepancy `.svg` in `_site/index.html` vs `.jpg` in source

- Verified `ADA_Proj1j.md` contains the JPG reference:

  Read snippet from `ADA_Proj1j.md` (lines 12-16):
  ```html
  <img src="/assets/My Avatar.jpg" alt="..." class="header-avatar" />
  ```

- Read generated `_site/index.html` showed `.svg` in the HTML (line ~18):
  ```html
  <img src="/assets/My Avatar.svg" alt="..." class="header-avatar" />
  ```

3) Observed Jekyll build directory context issue (builds ran from `assets/`):

- Sample build output captured when in wrong directory:
  Configuration file: none
  Source: C:/Users/User/Documents/ADA_Proj/assets
  Destination: C:/Users/User/Documents/ADA_Proj/assets/_site
  Generating... done

- Verified current working directory printed as `C:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj\assets` in one run.

4) Actions taken to fix caching/context:

- Deleted placeholder `avatar.svg` file (earlier created placeholder)
- Attempted `jekyll clean ; jekyll build` multiple times
- Found `.jekyll-cache` entries containing cached converted Markdown fragments referencing `.svg`
  - Example cached file path:
    `.jekyll-cache/Jekyll/Cache/Jekyll--Converters--Markdown/87/50da7d7f9c8b6165d43ba074edb24dd65fdd1c422156005257c44561b87aab`
  - That cache file included the `.svg` reference in converted HTML.

- Removed `.jekyll-cache` files and directories at repo root and nested under `assets/`.

5) Normalized avatar filename to avoid space/case issues

- Renamed `assets/My Avatar.jpg` → `assets/my-avatar.jpg` using PowerShell `Move-Item`.
- Updated `ADA_Proj1j.md` to reference `/assets/my-avatar.jpg`.
- Committed the rename and updated markdown; pushed to `origin/main`.

6) Rebuilt Jekyll from repository root and verified generated HTML

- Ensured location was `C:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj` by `Set-Location` / `Get-Location`.
- Ran `jekyll build` — sample output after correct rebuild:
  Configuration file: none
  Source: C:/Users/User/Documents/ADA_Proj
  Destination: C:/Users/User/Documents/ADA_Proj/_site
  Generating... done

- Verified `_site/index.html` now contained `src="/assets/my-avatar.jpg"`.

7) Git history examples captured during session

- Recent commit log (example lines captured):
  ```text
  80d0eff (HEAD -> main) Update avatar path to use my-avatar.jpg
  aff2963 Rename avatar file to my-avatar.jpg
  46e33aa (origin/main) Add avatar photo and update markdown
  e02ecfa Fix nav buttons stretch: add align-self start to prevent vertical expansion
  74b7cfb Fix avatar path (relative) and restore nav button sizes
  ```

8) README updates

- The assistant created/updated `README.md` with a compressed session transcript and build instructions, then committed and pushed it.

9) Cache and rebuild housekeeping performed:

- Removed `.jekyll-cache` at root and under `assets/` with `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`.
- Repeated `jekyll clean` and `jekyll build` until generated output referenced the JPG.

---

## Files edited by the assistant (high-level)

- `ADA_Proj1j.md` — updated avatar `img` tag to reference `/assets/my-avatar.jpg` and anonymized location text.
- `ADA_CSS.css` — added `.header-avatar` styling (120px circular image), and `align-self: start` to `.cv-nav` (fix for stretched nav buttons).
- `README.md` — updated with session summary and compressed transcript.
- `CHATLOG.md` — this file (raw transcript) was added in full.

---

## Important commands run (representative list)

- git commands
  - `git add -A ; git commit -m "..." ; git push origin main`
  - `git add ADA_Proj1j.md ; git commit -m "Update avatar path to use my-avatar.jpg" ; git push origin main`
  - `git log --oneline -n 5`

- Jekyll commands
  - `jekyll clean`
  - `jekyll build`
  - `jekyll serve --watch` (optional suggestion only)

- PowerShell file ops
  - `Remove-Item .jekyll-cache -Recurse -Force`
  - `Move-Item -LiteralPath "assets\My Avatar.jpg" -Destination "assets\my-avatar.jpg" -Force`
  - `Set-Location -Path "c:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj" -PassThru`

---

## Final verification steps performed

- Confirmed generated `_site/index.html` contains `<img src="/assets/my-avatar.jpg"`.
- Committed and pushed changes for avatar rename and README updates.

---

## Notes / Recommendations

- Prefer lowercase, dash-separated filenames for web assets (e.g., `my-avatar.jpg`) to avoid URL encoding and caching issues.
- Keep `_site/` excluded from the repository via `.gitignore`.
- If you want a fully timestamped raw terminal log, run your PowerShell history or export terminal logs while reproducing the steps; the assistant captured tool outputs available within this session.

## Recent steps (layout fixes)

- Commit `f7cce0d`: Tried `grid-row: 1 / -1` for dynamic stretching; revealed overlap issues.
- Commit `ec81b2c`: Added `grid-template-rows: auto auto 1fr` to `.cv-container` to define rows and prevent overlap.
- Commit `f508f66`: Added `align-items: flex-start` to `.cv-nav` to prevent nav buttons stretching vertically.
- Commit `a9067b4`: Implemented a more robust solution by wrapping the right column in `.right-col` (flex column) and making `.cv-content` flexible so the about section fills the vertical space beside the header.

Files changed in these steps:
- `ADA_CSS.css` — grid-template-rows, nav alignment, `.right-col` styles, and `.cv-content` adjustments.
- `ADA_Proj1j.md` — wrapped nav and main in `.right-col`.

Verification:
- Rebuilt site locally after each change and inspected `_site/index.html` to confirm generated paths and layout.
- Pushed commits to `origin/main`. Check recent commits in the log for IDs above.
