# Mahammad Sheykhov — CV & Portfolio

**Project: ADA_Proj**

**Project Summary**:
- **Purpose**: Single-page Jekyll-based CV/portfolio compiled from `ADA_Proj1j.md` into `index.html` and served via GitHub Pages.
- **Work done**: Interactive 6-section portfolio created, color palette restyled to warm earth tones, CSS/JS extracted from the markdown into separate files for maintainability.

**Files**:
- **`ADA_Proj1j.md`**: Main content (markdown + HTML structure). This is the Jekyll source for the homepage.
- **`_layouts/default.html`**: Jekyll layout wrapper (now references external CSS/JS)
- **`ADA_CSS.css`**: All site styles (extracted from the markdown)
- **`ADA_ProjJS.js`**: All client-side scripts (extracted from the markdown)
- **`_site/index.html`**: Generated site output (do not edit directly — generated by Jekyll)

**How to build locally**:
- Install Jekyll and Ruby (if not already installed).
- From the project folder (`c:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj`) run in PowerShell:

```powershell
# clean previous build
jekyll clean
# build the site into _site/
jekyll build
# (optional) serve locally with auto-regeneration
jekyll serve --watch
```

**Deployment & GitHub Pages**:
- The site is deployed using GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (pushes to `main` trigger new deployments).
- Older deployments are kept as records; only the latest deployment is active (green check).

Git commands (examples):
```powershell
# check changes
git status
# stage
git add .
# commit with message
git commit -m "Describe changes"
# push to origin/main
git push origin main
```

**Removing old generated HTML**:
- If you have an unwanted HTML file in repo root (e.g. `ADA_Proj1j.html`) remove it and rebuild:

```powershell
````markdown
# Mahammad Sheykhov — CV & Portfolio

**Project: ADA_Proj**

This repository contains a single-page Jekyll-based CV/portfolio. The site is authored in `ADA_Proj1j.md`, built by Jekyll into `_site/index.html`, and styled/behaved using `ADA_CSS.css` and `ADA_ProjJS.js`.

## Quick Start
- From the repo root (`c:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj`) build locally:

```powershell
jekyll clean
jekyll build
# optional: jekyll serve --watch
```

## Notes about `relative_url` and `baseurl`

- This project uses Jekyll's `relative_url` filter in templates and markdown to ensure asset paths (CSS, JS, images) work both locally and on GitHub Pages when the site is published under a repository subpath (for example: `https://Deeeeniz.github.io/ADA_Proj/`).
- `relative_url` prepends `site.baseurl` when it is set in `_config.yml`. I added a `_config.yml` with `baseurl: "/ADA_Proj"` so the site will correctly reference assets at `/ADA_Proj/...` on GitHub Pages. If you publish the site at the root domain instead, remove or empty `baseurl`.
- Example: `{{ '/assets/my-avatar.jpg' | relative_url }}` will become `/ADA_Proj/assets/my-avatar.jpg` when `baseurl: "/ADA_Proj"`.

If you'd rather use absolute paths without Liquid in the markdown, set `baseurl` appropriately in `_config.yml` (or leave it empty for root) and rebuild.


## Files of Interest
- `ADA_Proj1j.md` — main Jekyll source (markdown + HTML)
- `_layouts/default.html` — layout wrapper referencing `ADA_CSS.css` and `ADA_ProjJS.js`
- `ADA_CSS.css` — site styles
- `ADA_ProjJS.js` — client-side behavior
- `_site/index.html` — generated site output (do not edit directly)

## Changelog (high level)
- Extracted CSS and JS from `ADA_Proj1j.md` into `ADA_CSS.css` and `ADA_ProjJS.js`.
- Fixed navigation layout issues and added avatar styling.
- Added `_site/` to `.gitignore` and untracked generated files.

## Full Chat Transcript (extracted session)

Below is a cleaned and compressed extract of the interactive session and investigation we performed while editing this repository. It includes the main actions, decisions, and debugging performed during the session.

**Conversation Overview**
- Purpose: Documented the session where I helped you set up and refine your Jekyll-based CV site, add a circular avatar, anonymize location, fix layout issues, and resolve a generated-file mismatch (SVG vs JPG).

**Main objectives covered**
- Create/update README with explanation and build steps.
- Add circular avatar above the header name and anonymize address.
- Fix stretched nav buttons (CSS grid alignment issue).
- Clean git history and ensure `_site/` is ignored.
- Investigate and resolve mismatch where `_site/index.html` referenced `/assets/My Avatar.svg` while `ADA_Proj1j.md` referenced `/assets/My Avatar.jpg`.

**Actions taken**
- Added a `.gitignore` entry for `_site/` and untracked previously generated site files.
- Added and styled avatar image in `ADA_CSS.css` (class `.header-avatar` — 120px circle with `object-fit: cover`).
- Updated `ADA_Proj1j.md` to include the avatar image tag and anonymized the location text to "Baku, Azerbaijan (exact address omitted for privacy)".
- Fixed nav button stretching by adding `align-self: start;` to the `.cv-nav` rule.
- Diagnosed and fixed the avatar file mismatch by:
  - Removing the placeholder `avatar.svg` file.
  - Clearing `.jekyll-cache` files.
  - Renaming the committed avatar `assets/My Avatar.jpg` to `assets/my-avatar.jpg` to avoid issues with spaces/casing.
  - Updating `ADA_Proj1j.md` to use `/assets/my-avatar.jpg`.
  - Rebuilding Jekyll and verifying `_site/index.html` now references `/assets/my-avatar.jpg`.

**Debugging notes**
- Problem: Generated `_site/index.html` contained `/assets/My Avatar.svg` even though source markdown had `.jpg`.
- Findings:
  - A stale Jekyll cache and earlier builds executed from the wrong working directory (`assets/`) caused cached conversion fragments to persist.
  - There were `.jekyll-cache` directories (both at repo root and nested under `assets/`) containing cached converted HTML that referenced the old `.svg` path.
- Resolution steps performed:
  1. Ensured terminal was in the repo root (`c:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj`) before running `jekyll build`.
  2. Removed `.jekyll-cache` directories and specific cached conversion files.
  3. Rebuilt Jekyll to regenerate `_site` from the correct source.
  4. Normalized the avatar filename to `my-avatar.jpg` (lowercase, no spaces) and updated markdown.

**Commits created during session**
- `2b2ebd5` — Add `_site/` to `.gitignore` and untrack build output (example commit id shown earlier in session).
- `46e33aa` — Add avatar photo and update markdown (earlier commit containing the JPG upload).
- `e02ecfa` — Fix nav button stretch (add `align-self: start` to `.cv-nav`).
- `aff2963` / `80d0eff` — Rename avatar file to `my-avatar.jpg` and update markdown to reference it; rebuilt site and pushed.

**Current repo state (after fixes)**
- `ADA_Proj1j.md` references `/assets/my-avatar.jpg`.
- `assets/my-avatar.jpg` exists and is committed.
- `_site/index.html` (generated) now references `/assets/my-avatar.jpg`.
- `.jekyll-cache` was removed and Jekyll rebuilt from repo root.

**Recommendations & next steps**
- Keep filenames without spaces and use lowercase for web assets to avoid caching/URL encoding problems.
- Add a small CI check or pre-commit hook that runs `jekyll build` locally to catch mismatches before pushing (optional).
- If you'd like, I can:
  - Reformat this transcript into a separate `CHATLOG.md` instead of `README.md`.
  - Run a quick local verification and open `_site/index.html` in a browser (you can run `jekyll serve`).

## Recent Layout Fixes

- Commit `a9067b4`: Wrapped the right column (navigation + main content) in a `.right-col` wrapper and made `.cv-content` flexible so the about section fills the vertical gap beside the header. This avoids brittle grid hacks and lets the right column behave as a vertical flex layout.
- Commit `f508f66`: Added `align-items: flex-start` to `.cv-nav` to prevent nav buttons from stretching vertically.
- Commit `ec81b2c`: Added `grid-template-rows: auto auto 1fr` to `.cv-container` to let rows size naturally (nav, content, remaining space) and avoid overlap.
- Commit `f7cce0d`: (intermediate attempt) experimented with `grid-row: 1 / -1` to make elements stretch; reverted in favor of the flex-based `.right-col` approach because it caused overlap.

These changes were made to address a spacing issue where the header's height created an apparent 'forehead' gap on the right column; the fix makes the right column (nav + content) manage vertical space reliably.

## Responsive Design & Mobile Optimization

- Commit `47bca50`: Added comprehensive media queries for three breakpoints:
  - **1024px and below (tablets):** Grid collapses to single column, `.right-col` becomes flex column, nav and content stack vertically.
  - **768px and below (mobile):** Reduced padding, smaller fonts, optimized spacing; nav buttons wrap and shrink.
  - **480px and below (small screens):** Further reductions in padding, font sizes, and avatar size (120px → 100px → 80px).
  - Viewport meta tag already in place ensures browsers respect breakpoints.

- Commit `a67f974`: Fixed footer responsiveness:
  - Removed hardcoded `grid-column: 2` that locked footer to right column.
  - Added `grid-column: 1` in tablet breakpoint (1024px) so footer stacks properly when layout collapses.
  - Updated `border-radius: 0 0 8px 8px` to `border-radius: 8px` for consistent rounded corners.
  - Added mobile-specific footer styling with smaller padding and font sizes.

Site now responds correctly on all device sizes: desktop (two-column), tablet (stacked), and mobile (single column with optimized spacing).

## Multi-Page Conversion & Social Icons Integration

- Commit `67fe141`: Converted single-page portfolio to multi-page Jekyll site:
  - **New Pages Created**: Home (`index.md`), About, Education, Projects, Experience, Skills, Languages
  - **Social Icons Added**: GitHub, Codecademy, Codeforces, LeetCode icons in header with hover effects
  - **Navigation Updated**: Jekyll routing replaces JavaScript single-page navigation
  - **Homepage Features**: Welcome section with highlight cards and call-to-action buttons
  - **Complete CSS**: All styles for social icons, homepage, skills, languages, footer, and responsive design
  - **File Management**: Renamed old single-page file to `ADA_Proj1j_old.md`

Site now functions as a proper multi-page portfolio with social media integration and professional navigation.
