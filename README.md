# Mahammad Sheykhov — CV & Portfolio

**Project: ADA_Proj**

**Project Summary**:
- **Purpose**: Single-page Jekyll-based CV/portfolio compiled from `ADA_Proj1j.md` into `index.html` and served via GitHub Pages.
- **Work done**: Interactive 6-section portfolio created, color palette restyled to warm earth tones, CSS/JS extracted from the markdown into separate files for maintainability.

**Files**:
- **`ADA_Proj1j.md`**: Main content (markdown + HTML structure). This is the Jekyll source for the homepage.
- **`_layouts/default.html`**: Jekyll layout wrapper (now references external CSS/JS)
- **`ADA_CSS.css`**: All site styles (extracted from the markdown)
- **`ADA_ProjJS.js`**: All client-side scripts (extracted from the markdown)
- **`_site/index.html`**: Generated site output (do not edit directly — generated by Jekyll)

**How to build locally**:
- Install Jekyll and Ruby (if not already installed).
- From the project folder (`c:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj`) run in PowerShell:

```powershell
# clean previous build
jekyll clean
# build the site into _site/
jekyll build
# (optional) serve locally with auto-regeneration
jekyll serve --watch
```

**Deployment & GitHub Pages**:
- The site is deployed using GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (pushes to `main` trigger new deployments).
- Older deployments are kept as records; only the latest deployment is active (green check).

Git commands (examples):
```powershell
# check changes
git status
# stage
git add .
# commit with message
git commit -m "Describe changes"
# push to origin/main
git push origin main
```

**Removing old generated HTML**:
- If you have an unwanted HTML file in repo root (e.g. `ADA_Proj1j.html`) remove it and rebuild:

```powershell
````markdown
# Mahammad Sheykhov — CV & Portfolio

**Project: ADA_Proj**

This repository contains a single-page Jekyll-based CV/portfolio. The site is authored in `ADA_Proj1j.md`, built by Jekyll into `_site/index.html`, and styled/behaved using `ADA_CSS.css` and `ADA_ProjJS.js`.

## Quick Start
- From the repo root (`c:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj`) build locally:

```powershell
jekyll clean
jekyll build
# optional: jekyll serve --watch
```

## Files of Interest
- `ADA_Proj1j.md` — main Jekyll source (markdown + HTML)
- `_layouts/default.html` — layout wrapper referencing `ADA_CSS.css` and `ADA_ProjJS.js`
- `ADA_CSS.css` — site styles
- `ADA_ProjJS.js` — client-side behavior
- `_site/index.html` — generated site output (do not edit directly)

## Changelog (high level)
- Extracted CSS and JS from `ADA_Proj1j.md` into `ADA_CSS.css` and `ADA_ProjJS.js`.
- Fixed navigation layout issues and added avatar styling.
- Added `_site/` to `.gitignore` and untracked generated files.

## Full Chat Transcript (extracted session)

Below is a cleaned and compressed extract of the interactive session and investigation we performed while editing this repository. It includes the main actions, decisions, and debugging performed during the session.

**Conversation Overview**
- Purpose: Documented the session where I helped you set up and refine your Jekyll-based CV site, add a circular avatar, anonymize location, fix layout issues, and resolve a generated-file mismatch (SVG vs JPG).

**Main objectives covered**
- Create/update README with explanation and build steps.
- Add circular avatar above the header name and anonymize address.
- Fix stretched nav buttons (CSS grid alignment issue).
- Clean git history and ensure `_site/` is ignored.
- Investigate and resolve mismatch where `_site/index.html` referenced `/assets/My Avatar.svg` while `ADA_Proj1j.md` referenced `/assets/My Avatar.jpg`.

**Actions taken**
- Added a `.gitignore` entry for `_site/` and untracked previously generated site files.
- Added and styled avatar image in `ADA_CSS.css` (class `.header-avatar` — 120px circle with `object-fit: cover`).
- Updated `ADA_Proj1j.md` to include the avatar image tag and anonymized the location text to "Baku, Azerbaijan (exact address omitted for privacy)".
- Fixed nav button stretching by adding `align-self: start;` to the `.cv-nav` rule.
- Diagnosed and fixed the avatar file mismatch by:
  - Removing the placeholder `avatar.svg` file.
  - Clearing `.jekyll-cache` files.
  - Renaming the committed avatar `assets/My Avatar.jpg` to `assets/my-avatar.jpg` to avoid issues with spaces/casing.
  - Updating `ADA_Proj1j.md` to use `/assets/my-avatar.jpg`.
  - Rebuilding Jekyll and verifying `_site/index.html` now references `/assets/my-avatar.jpg`.

**Debugging notes**
- Problem: Generated `_site/index.html` contained `/assets/My Avatar.svg` even though source markdown had `.jpg`.
- Findings:
  - A stale Jekyll cache and earlier builds executed from the wrong working directory (`assets/`) caused cached conversion fragments to persist.
  - There were `.jekyll-cache` directories (both at repo root and nested under `assets/`) containing cached converted HTML that referenced the old `.svg` path.
- Resolution steps performed:
  1. Ensured terminal was in the repo root (`c:\Users\User\Documents\ADA_Proj`) before running `jekyll build`.
  2. Removed `.jekyll-cache` directories and specific cached conversion files.
  3. Rebuilt Jekyll to regenerate `_site` from the correct source.
  4. Normalized the avatar filename to `my-avatar.jpg` (lowercase, no spaces) and updated markdown.

**Commits created during session**
- `2b2ebd5` — Add `_site/` to `.gitignore` and untrack build output (example commit id shown earlier in session).
- `46e33aa` — Add avatar photo and update markdown (earlier commit containing the JPG upload).
- `e02ecfa` — Fix nav button stretch (add `align-self: start` to `.cv-nav`).
- `aff2963` / `80d0eff` — Rename avatar file to `my-avatar.jpg` and update markdown to reference it; rebuilt site and pushed.

**Current repo state (after fixes)**
- `ADA_Proj1j.md` references `/assets/my-avatar.jpg`.
- `assets/my-avatar.jpg` exists and is committed.
- `_site/index.html` (generated) now references `/assets/my-avatar.jpg`.
- `.jekyll-cache` was removed and Jekyll rebuilt from repo root.

**Recommendations & next steps**
- Keep filenames without spaces and use lowercase for web assets to avoid caching/URL encoding problems.
- Add a small CI check or pre-commit hook that runs `jekyll build` locally to catch mismatches before pushing (optional).
- If you'd like, I can:
  - Reformat this transcript into a separate `CHATLOG.md` instead of `README.md`.
  - Run a quick local verification and open `_site/index.html` in a browser (you can run `jekyll serve`).

_This transcript was extracted and condensed from an interactive editing session in the repository workspace on the user's machine. If you want the full raw session (terminal commands, exact timestamps, and each tool output), I can produce a separate `CHATLOG.md` containing the unabridged logs._
